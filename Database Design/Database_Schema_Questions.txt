  [X] Instrument will depend on VD2 unless VD2==9, then on UEDR+VD1...
  [X] Implement out domain tables for:
	- Instrument/VD2 (done)		  -- ability to add instrument for VD2==9 variations
	- VocalRange/VD1 (done)
	- Folder/Filetype (xml, sib, pdf) -- ability to add a filetype to WIP
  [ ] The presence of some info in a SONG table can check off some of the "SONG Progress Steps"
  [ ] Presence of a Link in a song precludes presence of files in a variation (just generate a warning)

1. Will all variations of a song in the same vocal range be in the same key?
	E.g. 000200-3X are all in B-flat?
	or will transposing instruments give a different key
	If transposing instruments DO give a different key, is it set by the second digit of the variation?
	How will 000200-X9 be handled? Could these be in any key?

ANS
	The key will be different, the clarient in B-flat (33) will always be printed a tone higher than the original (30)
	So, the key difference will be static HOWEVER I think it should wtill be written that the variation is in the key of (30)
	For e.g. tenor and french horn, french horn (and its transposing key) will be recorded somewehre and be put under 'X9'

2. Will every song belong to a work?
	Doesn't matter - songs that don't have a work name or opus number will have a WorkUID with no name

ANS
	(G) Larger Work Title (optional)	(H) Individual Song title		(I) Opus number of larger work OR Individual Song		(J) (If (I) exists) Indivudial Song Number

	If a song is NOT part of a largerWORK, its title is ONLY in (H)
	If there is no (G), then the Song/work number is in (I)
	'Cycle' = Larger Work


3. Will every work have the same librettist for all its songs?
	Rare exceptions. For fuck sake.
	Don't bother. JK, do it.

	2% of the time, there are MULTIPLE LIBRETTISTS
	THERE WOULDN'T BE 10 MULTIPLE COMPOSERS
	> the comments section can deal with this

4. Will every work be entirely in 1 language?
	Rosen Cavellier is a German Opera with a single Italian song in it
	> Don't fuss it

5. Can all filenames be formulaic?
	N.B. the database will store files based on UEDR and Variation Number

	Rafferty Extended File name (for customer download)
	E.g. Puccini - Gianni Schicci - Oh Mia Bambino Caro - transpose - Horn
	No numbers, except for Bach - he has BWV numbers at the start... and Mozart a little bit
	E.g. Cantata BWVXXX - [Aria_name] - Transposed - Oboe
	> Have an auto-generated File name
	> Let Carl edit it

6. How strict is the "variation-instrument" relation?
	... there must be a place to add a custom instrument name
	for X9

7. Precisely which steps of progress pertain ONLY to the song, and which to the variation?
	Are there any shared steps? --> put them under VariationProgress
	Will the source XML file be used for all Variations? (SEE 10.)
	Will there be an extra step of "writing the new accompaniment" for some variations?
ANS
	A Sibleius file contains all the parts at once
	A song with 0X, 1X, and 2X transpositions will have 3 Sibelius files\
	I.e. each variation will have 1 file

	> WAIT 6 MONTHS --> When creating an extra part (e.g. flute), Carl may do it in a new Sibelius file (or consider now ??)
	> largely, additional instrumental parts will come later

8. Can you HOLD a variation? or only a song?
ANS
	just for song, leave Variation Hold for later

9. Will you want a separate Notes section for songs and variations?
ANS
	Yes.

10. Will a LINK pertain to the song or the variation?
ANS
	The song

11. IRISH TRAD, who's the composer?
ANS
	E.g. The Kerry(?) Dance
... how does that answer the question?
